## Introduction

The TS-Utils package stems from an idea of having a comprehensive TypeScript utility library designed to streamline the development workflow. \
The library offers a wide range of functions that simplify common programming tasks and provide essential tools to enhance your TypeScript projects with ease.

This package serves as a valuable tool for TypeScript developers looking to enhance their projects with efficient and reusable functionality.&#x20;

The TS-Utils package is meant for TypeScript developers who want to save time and effort by leveraging pre-built utility functions.&#x20;

By using this package, you can avoid writing repetitive code and focus on building the core functionality of your application without worry.&#x20;

The package is particularly useful for projects that require frequent data manipulation, formatting, or handling.&#x20;

&#x20;By utilizing these functions, you can write more concise, readable, and maintainable code, ultimately improving the overall quality of your TypeScript projects.

## Installation

The library is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@check-engineering/ts-utils).

However, to install the cpb-utils package, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @check-engineering/ts-utils

# Using yarn
yarn add @check-engineering/ts-utils
```

These commands will fetch and install the TS-Utils package from the package registry, making it available for use in your TypeScript project.

### Usage

Once you have the package installed, you can import the specific utility functions you need using the ES6 import statement. Here's an example of how to import individual functions:

```typescript
// Import the specific method category you need
import { chunk, formatDate, capitalize } from "kam-utils1000/array.ts";
import { roundNum, clampNum } from "kam-utils1000/number.ts";

// OR Import all utilities
import { formatDate, roundNum } from "kam-utils1000";
```
